# Insulin Calculator Demo for Robert

This is a simple Android app that demonstrates basic programming concepts like conditionals and basic Android UI workflow by taking the user's inputs (target & current) and outputting a total value (correction)

At its current state, it is NOT a true insulin caculator yet. All it does is takes the `target` value and subtracts `current` value to calculate the `correction` value.

To make the app user-friendly, the `correction` value's color changes to indicate a positive value vs. a negative one. Check the comments to see how that works and see if you can expand it!
